Three tasks to get used to classes in python.
============================================
-  CashDesk-illustration of how cashdesk works. 
-  FileSystem-couple of functions, which we had to write 
   so we could see how functions like **cat** or **du -hs work**.
-  Fraction-implementing fractions and instruments to work with them
