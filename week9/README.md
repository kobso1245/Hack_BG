The **brand_new** folder stores bank-like system, where you
can register a new account, register a new client, reset email and password
and all sort of usefull stuff.
If you want to use it you should install the requirements, set up an smtp server(write down
the needed info in the sending_settings file) and run **interface.py** module.
